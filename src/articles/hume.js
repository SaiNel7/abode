        <p> Hume’s claim is that the observable balance of pleasure and suffering in the world undermines the inference that its designer possesses the moral perfection traditionally attributed to God. In other words, the existence of widespread evil counts as empirical evidence against divine benevolence.</p>
        <p>Hume’s reasoning is grounded in empiricism such that we can only infer causes from observed effects. If the effects (the world) are mixed, being partly good or partly evil, then the cause (the supposed creator) cannot be known to be perfectly good or powerful.  Still, one might question whether this view of morality assumes a universe centered around human existence which is largely a speck in the timeline of existence. Perhaps even what we call inherent evils such as natural disasters, disease, even suffering, fit within a larger, incomprehensible order, as Eastern philosophies suggest. From that lens, good and evil are illusory distinctions within a unified whole. </p>
        <p>Yet Hume’s challenge remains relevant, if morality itself is our measure, then the world’s disorder leads us to doubt divine perfection and maybe be an argument for deism.</p>
        </p>
