    <p>A nation burns to ashes. Its citizens cry as they lose their sovereignty and their beloved, compassionate leader is forced into hiding. The scene then shifts to a lofty man ascending a beautiful mountain with his son, rekindling the embers of filial love and warmth. Jean Jacques Annaud's film, Seven Years in Tibet, serves as a critical reminder of the continued colonial, oppressive thought that plagues Hollywood and its cinema. The film tells a tale of the indomitable spirit of the Tibetan people, who throughout all their existence, battle constant oppression and live in an aura of mysticism until a conflicted, but well-meaning white man arrives to find himself and meet his destiny as the savior of Tibet. In actuality, the film is riddled with moronic stereotypes and the fantasization of the East, downplaying the actual struggle of the Tibetan people under the Chinese Communist Party's oppressive regime as some mere side story in a Caucasian man's journey to find himself. By examining the film through a post-colonial lens, this paper aims to uncover the intricate dynamics of the white savior complex and the continued oppression of the Tibetan people. This analysis will employ instances from the film as evidence, supported by academic sources.</p>
    <p>"Seven Years in Tibet" prominently features the white savior complex, a recurring theme in many Western narratives set in non-Western contexts. Heinrich Harrer, portrayed by Brad Pitt, arrives in Tibet as a self-centered Austrian mountaineer and undergoes a transformation into a compassionate figure who influences the young Dalai Lama and the Tibetan society. Annaud's film starts in 1939, with Harrer's attempt to summit Nanga Parbat, the ninth-highest mountain on the planet. However, Harrer's dreams are soon thwarted by the outbreak of the Second World War as he is captured and held as a prisoner of war in British India. Harrer's eventual escape leads him to what is portrayed as the secluded world of Tibet, where his interactions with the 14th Dalai Lama and immersion in the local culture challenge his preconceived notions and instigate a profound personal transformation. Harrer's initial portrayal as an arrogant and ethnocentric Westerner who is indifferent to the cultures he encounters reflects typical colonial attitudes. His journey to Tibet, driven by a desire for personal glory, embodies the colonial mindset of exploiting foreign lands for personal gain. As Harrer spends more time in Tibet, he undergoes a personal transformation. This narrative arc, where a Western character finds redemption and purpose through their interaction with a non-Western culture, is a hallmark of the white savior trope. Edward Said's seminal work on Orientalism provides a framework for understanding how Western representations of the East often serve to justify colonial domination, explaining that by "othering" a culture, the white man is able to put himself as the savior of those people. We can see the actualization of this jingoistic mentality during the Philippine-American War in 1899. Ruyard Kipling writes a painfully disturbing reminder of the white savior complex and atrocities of colonialism as he states "Take up the White Man's burden– The savage wars of peace– Fill full the mouth of Famine And bid the sickness cease" proposing that the white race is a moral obligation to civilize the colored peoples, fostering their progress via imperialism (Kipling). This bigoted narrative illustrates the perception held by the West on the Philippines, viewing Filipinos as "half-devil and half-child" brutes to be domesticated. (Kipling) While Annaud is not as direct with his bigotry, via Harrer's character arc, he suggests Tibetan people require the intervention and guidance of a Westerner to navigate their political and cultural challenges. It reinforces the notion of Western superiority and the indispensability of Western influence in "civilizing" and aiding non-Western societies.</p>
    <p>In "Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West," Donald Lopez examines the Western fascination with Tibetan Buddhism and how this fascination often leads to the exoticization of Tibetan culture. The film portrays the culture as mysterious, otherworldly, and fundamentally different from the familiar norms of the West. The use of wide, sweeping shots of the Himalayan landscape and serene temples enhances this perception, which leads to the oversimplification of Tibetan culture into easily digestible stereotypes (e.g., peaceful monks, serene landscapes) serve to make the culture more palatable and intriguing to Western audiences. This pruning of the complexities of the culture and its people reinforces colonial hierarchies and that non-Western cultures are inherently different and inferior, needing intervention from the rational white man. The romanticization of the Tibetan landscape in the film serves to exoticize the culture and environment, presenting Tibet as an untouched, mystical land awaiting Western discovery and intervention to save its poor people from themselves. According to Peter Bishop's "The Myth of Shangri-La: Tibet, Travel Writing, and the Western Creation of Sacred Landscape," Western travel narratives have constructed an idealized image of Tibet, often neglecting the complexities of Tibetan society, a message which Annaud disseminates in his choice of cinematic techniques. He uses a warm, golden hue in the film's color palette when depicting the spiritual and peaceful aspects of Tibetan life. These scenes are underscored with ambient sounds and traditional Tibetan music, creating an aura of mysticism. While these depictions evoke empathy and admiration, they also risk simplifying and essentializing Tibetan culture as static and monolithic, reinforcing Orientalist notions of the East as a mystical and unchanging realm.</p>
    <p>Harrer's role as mentor to the Dalai Lama is the most blatant rendition in Annaud's piece of the white savior complex. Harre is portrayed as this hero for bringing the greatest Western invention, a rickety cinema, to the Tibetan people, fixing a broken projector. Ironically, this act of fixing a broken projector can be seen as a metaphor for the white savior's superficially extravagant yet fundamentally insignificant contributions to their ego project of saving colored people. This short storyline is meant to be moving and showcase the increasing relationship between the Dalai Lama and Harrer with intimate close-up shots but rather, only cements Harrer's nature as a self serving opportunist that is only taking advantage of the situation. It is perhaps easy to forget in the film given Annaud's exceptional direction, after Harrer's failure to summit Nanga Parbat and his capture, he is a void of man as his wife leaves him, he is persecuted by British and German armies alike and is at essence, a dead man walking. In fact, the dialogue during Harrer's lessons to the Dalai Lama often involve Western ideas and technology, positioning him as an indispensable guide. In his article published in the Atlantic, Teju Cole critiques the white savior complex as a manifestation of neocolonialism, where Western individuals and organizations position themselves as indispensable heroes. (Cole 2) Teju Cole's critique of the "White Savior Industrial Complex" emphasizes how well-intentioned Western interventions often reinforce power imbalances and perpetuate neocolonial attitudes. Cole argues that these interventions are more about satisfying Western needs to feel benevolent than genuinely addressing the root causes of issues in non-Western contexts. This perspective aligns with the depiction of Harrer in "Seven Years in Tibet," where his transformation and contributions are foregrounded over the agency and resilience of the Tibetan people. Evidently, Harrer's dynamic as a mentor in the film only reinforces the white savior trope, ludicrously suggesting that the Tibetan leader and, by extension, the Tibetan people, need Western knowledge and guidance to navigate their future, diminishing the agency and wisdom of the Tibetan characters.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the film depicts the Chinese invasion of Tibet and the subsequent oppression of the Tibetan people, illustrating the stark contrast between the previously peaceful Tibetan society and the violent occupation by Chinese forces, through a lens that while elicits sympathy from the audience, reduces the Tibetan identity to one of victimhood. As well as viewing the situation through Harrer's perspective, creating a muddled lens, Annaud uses lighting to emphasize the dramatic shift from peace to conflict. Tibetan scenes are often bathed in warm, golden light, symbolizing serenity and spirituality. In contrast, the scenes depicting the Chinese invasion are characterized by cold, harsh lighting, creating a visual representation of the brutality and oppression brought by the invaders. The sound design further amplifies this contrast. The serene soundscape of Tibetan daily life, filled with ambient natural sounds and traditional music, is violently interrupted by the aggressive sounds of military machinery, gunfire, and explosions during the invasion. This auditory shift underscores the disruption and violence inflicted upon Tibet. The portrayal of the Chinese invasion serves multiple purposes within the narrative. It elicits sympathy for the Tibetan people and their plight, highlighting the external oppression they face. However, this framing also has drastic implications from a post-colonial perspective. By focusing on the Chinese invasion and its effects on Tibet through the eyes of Heinrich Harrer, a Western protagonist, the narrative centers Western perspectives on Tibetan victimhood. This can overshadow the agency, resistance, and resilience of the Tibetan people themselves. Gayatri Spivak's research and notion of the subaltern highlights how marginalized voices are often silenced or appropriated in dominant narratives. The film's focus on Harrer's perspective can be seen as overshadowing the voices and experiences of the Tibetan people, aligning with Spivak's critique. As such, there is a portrayal of Tibetans as primarily passive victims rather than active agents of their own resistance and cultural preservation. Which aligns with colonial narratives that often depict colonized peoples as helpless and in need of external (Western) saviors, serving prejudiced Western narratives.</p>
    <p>In the latter part of "Seven Years in Tibet," Heinrich Harrer undergoes a significant transformation. He becomes more humble and compassionate, learning from his experiences and the people he encounters in Tibet. Eventually, he decides to leave Tibet, marking the culmination of his personal journey. As Harrer integrates more with Tibetan society, the framing of scenes becomes more inclusive. He is often shown interacting closely with Tibetan characters, indicating his growing connection and empathy. The lighting in scenes featuring Harrer becomes softer and warmer, symbolizing his inner change and newfound humility. Annaud utilizes both dialogue and monologue to reveal Harrer's internal growth and changing worldview, as Harrer's conversations with the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan characters become more introspective. However, examining this growth through a post-colonial lens, the crux of the narrative is on his personal journey of growth and redemption which overshadows the greater political and cultural struggles of the Tibetan people, reducing their experiences to a backdrop for the Western protagonist's story. Moreover, the trope of Western Heroism is continued to be upheld by depicting Harrer as a figure who learns, changes, and ultimately becomes a better person through his time in Tibet. Annaud suggests that the Western character is essential for bringing positive change, both to himself and to the non-Western society he engages with and perhaps without, the people of Tibet would remain backwards. The transformation narrative often sidelines the voices and experiences of the Tibetan characters. Their struggles, agency, and resilience are less emphasized compared to Harrer's personal development, and as such, the film risks simplifying the complex political and cultural issues faced by Tibetans, framing them in a way that serves the protagonist's narrative arc rather than giving them the depth and attention they deserve. Said's concept of Orientalism explains how the West constructs the East as an exotic, inferior "Other" to define its own identity. Harrer's journey is then just a means to render the Tibetan experience to the background. In addition, Spivak's work on the subaltern highlights how marginalized voices are often silenced or appropriated in Western discourses. In "Seven Years in Tibet," the Tibetan characters are frequently depicted through a Western lens, their voices and experiences mediated by the narrative of Harrer's journey. The film ends with what is supposed to be a poignant scene. Harrer reconnects with his son, symbolizing his new-found growth and wisdom, and ascends a glistening mountain in the Alps, smiling and embracing his child. As beautiful as the Swiss Alps are, they do not hide the bitter aftertaste left after watching this movie. Why is that this man gets to walk away scot-free while Tibet smolders? It is here we reach the crux of the white savior issue. These alleged heroes who have brought light and civility to the colored peoples have nothing at stake. It is a mere fallacy that there was anything beyond personal fulfillment in that effort.</p>
    <p>As conflicts persist across the globe, the drive to find purpose in saving "others" can often lead us astray. It is crucial that in our attempts to help, we retain the wisdom to see people as individuals with their own dreams and agencies, rather than reducing them to generalized stereotypes or mere recipients of our benevolence. We must ask ourselves why narratives about people of color are so often told through the lens of a white protagonist. What compels the patronization and infantilization of entire cultures, as seen in the portrayal of Tibetan struggles through the eyes of Heinrich Harrer in "Seven Years in Tibet"? Why must the white man be the central figure in the story of Tibet's annexation and resistance? This pattern reflects deep-seated colonial attitudes and perpetuates the notion that non-Western peoples require Western intervention to achieve progress or even to narrate their own stories. It is essential to challenge these narratives and strive for more authentic and diverse storytelling that respects and amplifies the voices and experiences of those directly affected. In moving forward, let us commit to dismantling the white savior complex and promoting a more equitable and accurate representation of all peoples. By doing so, we honor their humanity and acknowledge their capacity to shape their own destinies without the need for external saviors.</p>
