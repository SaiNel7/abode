    <p> Descartes starts his first Meditation by reflecting on the notion that he has delayed the project of truly critiquing his opinions for so long that he must now prioritize the execution of ridding himself of false beliefs over the comfortable pondering of what those beliefs are. How does one achieve a balance of the two to optimize the betterment of oneself? I find we are often bogged down in our thoughts and almost debilitated, sitting in inaction. Descartes himself acknowledges that universal doubt is unstable, he risks slipping back into old habits the moment he stops actively resisting them.
    </p>
    <p> The process of stripping away fundamental beliefs, whether in the pursuit of truth or self-understanding, is so difficult that one is pushed back toward a state of inertia, and not simply out of laziness, but because the mind seems unable to stay perpetually suspended in doubt. Descartes intends this doubt only as a temporary methodological tool, but even so, I wonder whether such an undertaking is worth the effort, even for a brief glimpse at something indubitable.
    </p>
    <p> Then we must ask how do we recognize fundamental truth if all our senses and perceptions are to be doubted? From a modern standpoint, psychology suggests that we cannot access or neutralize most of our subconscious beliefs. If so, can we genuinely reject the foundational opinions we’ve inherited and internalized, or does Descartes assume a level of self-transparency we simply do not have?
    </p>
    <p> Descartes introduces the hypothesis of an all-powerful malicious deceiver, not to make us cynical of everyday interactions, but to challenge the reliability of our cognitive faculties themselves. Yet is it even possible to be so aware of our true nature that we can recognize the subtlest biases and habits formed over a lifetime? After all, if we can doubt the senses, why not doubt sanity itself? Descartes refuses to consider the possibility of madness, but are we not all “mad” in subtle ways, shaped by biases and dispositions we cannot fully see? Perhaps Descartes could be fully cognizant of his basic opinions, but can I, can we? How does one achieve such awareness, if the very tools we use to scrutinize ourselves are the ones we are supposed to doubt?
