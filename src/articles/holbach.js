    <p>Holbach argues that human freedom is an illusion, that every action we take is the necessary consequence of prior causes such as biological, social, and psychological which determine us as certainly as physical laws determine matter. He writes, “The man who is ignorant of the causes which move him is the sport of illusions; he believes himself free while he is only the slave of his passions.” For Holbach, freedom means not acting without cause, but acting without external restraint and in understanding the necessity that shapes us.
    </p>
    <p> Holbach believes this because he sees humans as part of nature, not separate from it. Just as the planets move according to physical necessity, our minds move according to causal laws. The illusion of free will arises from our ignorance of these causes, we feel free only because we don’t understand what determines us.
    </p>
    <p> But I find this deeply unsettling. If our wants and motives are predetermined, what meaning does it have to “be true to oneself”? Holbach might reply that even the act of resistance is itself determined, that yearning and struggle are simply more causes unfolding. Yet perhaps freedom lies within that struggle, in recognizing our conditioning, questioning it, and consciously shaping new causes through education, reflection, and moral action, bringing us closer to our truest selves. That I believe is the only significant trait humanity is capable of.
